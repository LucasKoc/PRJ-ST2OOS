# PRJ-ST2OOS
Project - ST2OOS - OO Systems Development (I2 - 2425S7) - 2024/2025

### Context

This project is a Project for the course "PRJ - OO Systems Development (ST2OOS)". The goal is to create a REST API and a gRPC server to manage school class information.

Language/tools used is **Python** with **FastAPI**, **gRPC** and **PostgreSQL**.
This project use Docker to run the services.

### Objectives

- code at least two services communicating (one using the REST architecture, the
other the RPC architecture)
- Each service must have its own database (more than one type of database is
desirable : SQL, NoSQLâ€¦)
- Respect the rules given in the following project (to be adapted according to the
programming language):
  - Layering (No business code in the web layer)
  - Logger (ex in java: Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);)
  - Exception handling with HttpStatus code and message
  - OpenAPI documentation (Swagger)
  - Testing (unit tests, web tier tests)
- The services must be documented according to the Open API specification
(Swagger). Show screenshots in the Readme page oy your repository.
- Explain your project in the Readme page.
- The Rest service must be accessible via curl (give the list of the requests in the
Readme of your repository), or via a Javascript program (noted as a bonus) (give
screenshots in the Readme page) (separate the services from the Javascript
program on separated servers).

### Installation and configuration
